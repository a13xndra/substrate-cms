			"question": "I am not a [Substrate] developer, can I still participate?",

		{
			"question": "Is this related to Substrate Collaborative Learning?",
			"answer": "Yes! Substrate Collaborative Learning was the previous harder-to-pronounce iteration of Substrate Seminar. When we decided to start meeting every week, and have a more discoverable web presence, we rebranded. If you liked Substrate Collaborative Learning, you'll love Substrate Seminar. The <a href='https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLp0_ueXY_enUCPszf_3Q9ZxovLvKm1eMx'>SCL recordings</a> are still available."
